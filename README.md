SMS spam or ham ML app

I have created a sms spam or ham webapp using streamlit web application.

Requirements I have used:

1. pandas

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. seaborn

5. scikit-learn

6. streamlit

7. pickle-mixin

Ide used is Jupyter Notebook(for creating a model) and Pycharm(for web application).

I have downloaded the dataset in kaggle website which was updated the csv file on 01-07-2023. By using this data set I have done EDA and feature extraction counter vectorizer to convert the alphabetical to numerical.

By using Naive Bayes (Multinomial) algorithm I have created the model and got training score is 98% and testing score is 95% and created ROC AUC curve for training and testing data and got an average score is 95%. And created confusion matrix and classification report.
